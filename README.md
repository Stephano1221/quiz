# Quiz
Quiz application for educational use

The quiz is aimed towards students and their teachers to allow for teachers to assess students, and for students to assess
their knowledge in topics assigned by their teacher.

Students can pick a topic to play, where they will be asked a series of random questions added by their teacher. Their score is
shown at the end of the quiz, along with their percentage. Their score is added to a leaderboard which is only visible by teachers.
